## 🧬 What is FlowGenesis?

**FlowGenesis** is a bleeding-edge SaaS platform that transforms natural language into complex, production-grade AI automation workflows — using the agentic power of **n8n**, **LLM agents**, and **self-improving loop intelligence**.

It doesn't just create automations. It creates **automation engines**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

You tell FlowGenesis what you want:

```bash
"Build me an automation that scrapes Hacker News, analyzes top posts by sentiment, stores them in Notion, and alerts me on Slack every 2 hours."
```

FlowGenesis responds with:
✅ A fully-working, authenticated, error-handled **n8n flow**
✅ Performance-tested & refined using **agent feedback loops**
✅ Explained step-by-step with visual + JSON output

## 🚀 Architecture Overview

### 🧩 Core Modules

* **Prompt Orchestrator (LLM1)**: Interprets the user's intent and expands it into structured task plans.
* **Flow Generator (LLM2)**: Translates each step into n8n-compliant flow JSON.
* **Prompt Refinement Loop (LLM3)**: Iteratively enhances vague or incomplete inputs.
* **Auto-Test Engine**: Simulates triggers, auth, and path traversal using stubbed and live runs.
* **Agent Evolution Layer**: Evolves each workflow variant over 20–200 iterations to maximize clarity, error-resilience, and speed.
